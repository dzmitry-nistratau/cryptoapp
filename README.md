## Technology Prioritization

The focus was on ensuring the core functionality is robust and non-blocking for the user flow.

The priorities included:

- Creating a universal application using Expo and Expo Router for both mobile devices and the web.
- Implementing Mobx for efficient state management and storage of cryptocurrency data.
- Ensuring basic error handling is in place, with integrated navigation support to guide users.
- Utilizing Zod for type-safe data validation.
- Leveraging pre-built components from the react-native-paper library, which are compatible with both mobile and web platforms.
- Setting up basic theming with branded colors to maintain a consistent visual identity across the application.
- Deploying the web application using Expo EAS Hosting for a straightforward and accessible demonstration, complemented by a sharable Expo app link.
- While this solution does not encompass all potential improvements and extensions, I am eager to discuss them further during a conversation.
